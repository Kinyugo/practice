# Virtualization 
Virtualization involves simulating something virtually and essentially abstracting the real thing from direct usage and interaction, e.g: in computing guest vitual machines may run on virtual hardware that simulates the real hardware functionality. 

## Types of virtualization 
1. Desktop virtualization: this involves running a guest operating system or software on the host machine using virtualization software.
2. Storage virtualization: a pool of storage devices may be virtualized so that they can be operated and accessed as a single storage device. 
3. Network virtualization: the entire computer network within an organization may be virtualized so it can be managed and controlled from a central system. 
4. Server virualization: resources of a single server can be partitions into virtual servers that run indipendent of each other and hence users can be allocated resources according to their needs. 
5. Application virtualization: an organization may choose to centralize an application in a way that it can be used and accessed on other systems without having to install it first. 

## Benefits of virtualization 
1. Increased productivity 
2. Flexibility
3. Better access control 
4. Cost effectiveness
