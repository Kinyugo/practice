## What is DNA? 

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is heriditary molecule found in all living organisms that defines the genetic instructions for the growth, development, functioning and reproductions of the organism. DNA information is encoded by four bases adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T) and cytosine (C). These bases pair with each other to form base pairs A with T and G with C.

## Structure of DNA
DNA has a double helix structure, each strand is made up of alternating deoxyribose sugar and a phosphate group. Each sugar has a base attached to it. The two strands are then held together by the bonds between the alterating base pairs.

## Differences between DNA and RNA
| **DNA**                               | **RNA**                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Bases are A, G, C, U                  | Bases are A, G, C, T                    |
| Double stranded                       | Single stranded                         |
| Has deoxyribose sugar                 | Has ribose sugar                        |
| Found in the nucleus and mitochondria | Found in the nucleus and the cytoplasm  |
| Stable and thus has a long lifetime   | Unstable and thus has a short lifetime  |
| Undergoes transcription to become RNA | Undergoes translation to become protein |
