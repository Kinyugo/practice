# Molecular Biology Concepts 

## What is DNA? 

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is heriditary molecule found in all living organisms that defines the genetic instructions for the growth, development, functioning and reproductions of the organism. DNA information is encoded by four bases adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T) and cytosine (C). These bases pair with each other to form base pairs A with T and G with C.

## Structure of DNA
DNA has a double helix structure, each strand is made up of alternating deoxyribose sugar and a phosphate group. Each sugar has a base attached to it. The two strands are then held together by the bonds between the alterating base pairs.

## Differences between DNA and RNA
| **DNA**                               | **RNA**                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Bases are A, G, C, U                  | Bases are A, G, C, T                    |
| Double stranded                       | Single stranded                         |
| Has deoxyribose sugar                 | Has ribose sugar                        |
| Found in the nucleus and mitochondria | Found in the nucleus and the cytoplasm  |
| Stable and thus has a long lifetime   | Unstable and thus has a short lifetime  |
| Undergoes transcription to become RNA | Undergoes translation to become protein |

## Central Dogma of Molecular Biology 
The central dogma is the gene process by which DNA is converted into proteins. It explains the process by which DNA is transcribed to mRNA then to RNA is translated to protein. The central dogma states that DNA contains the instructions for making proteins, the messanger RNA carries this information to the ribosomes which then synthesizes the proteins.

## What are Mutations?
Mutations are changes in the DNA that can result from (but not only): DNA replication mistakes, exposure to radiation and mutagens and viral infections. Germ line mutations occur in the eggs and sperm and can be passed on to offspring, while somatic mutations occur in body cells and are not passed on. 

## Different types of Mutation
There are 3 types of DNA mutations: base substituions, deletions and insertions
### 1. Base Substituions 
There are point mutations where a base pair is replaced with another. 
  1. **Transition**: this is when a purine is sustituted with another purine or when a pyrimidine is substituted with another pyrimidine. 
  2. **Transversion**: this is when a purine is substitued with pyrimidine and vice-versa. 
  
### 2. Deletions
A deletion occurs when one or more base pairs are lost from the DNA. If one or two bases are deleted, the translationa frame is altered resulting in a non-functional protein. If three or more bases are deleted the reading frame is left intact although the protein will be missing one or more amino acids. 

### 3. Insertions
An insertions occurs when one or more base pairs are added. This may lead to a frameshift resulting in a non-functional protein. 

## Concept of open reading frames 
An open reading frame is a portion of DNA that contains no stop codons after gene expression. These are spans of DNA sequence between start and stop codons.
